## Changes

2022/09/06 Created new branch `pyXsurf_nbdev` for experimenting with
nbdev under WSL. 2021/07/21 Upgraded installation mechanism. 2020/11/09
Changed repository name from `pyXTel` to `pyXSurf`.

## Installation

Download or clone the project. You can use git clone command by:
`git clone https://github.com/vincenzooo/pyXSurf.git` or the button
`download` at top of page. It can be advisable to update your
environment, and especially `pip` to the most recent version. At this
point you have two options:

1.  Python installer (suggested): move to the folder with the code and
    call `python setup.py install`. This will perform a “regular”
    installation (meaning that the code is copied to `site-packages`
    folders, which holds all installed Python libraries) and made
    accessible to your system.

2.  Manual (developer): as in option 1, just use `pip install -e .` or
    `pip install -e '.[dev]'`. Doing this, the library will be installed
    from current position (no local copy), any change to the original
    code will be immediately available in the imported library (the
    second one, with the `[dev]`option will install additional files
    with tests and tools).

Code can be uninstalled in same way with `pip uninstall pyXsurf`, or
calling directly the setup file `python setup.py develop  -u`
(uninstalling developer installation is expected to work only with most
recent pip versions, at least \>=19.1.1)).

There are developer branches on github, which have extra functionalities
at the moment under development (they are quite messy, so feel free to
ask if you are looking for something in particular). These can be
installed in the same way and should work equally (just have more
unfinished stuff). For git beginners, the only thing you need to do
differently, is to switch branch, e.g. `git checkout documentation`
(where `documentation` is the name of the branch) before running the
setup. Please check developers notes for a list of active branches and
their features and for more details. Also, if you plan to make changes
to the code and want to keep the changes automatically in synch,
remember to install the code in “developer mode” (as explained above).

## How to use

At this point you can open Python and try `import pySurf`, if this works
without errors, you can go to the tutorials section.

You can test a succesful installation with:

``` python
from pysXsurf.data2D import data2D
```

running single .py files usually run small test scripts at the end of
the module.

## Status of the library

The main part of the library is well defined and it works well. I am
constantly adding functions when I find they are needed during my daily
work.

I have tried the installation on a few computers and it worked smoothly
by `setup.py`. You are very welcome to help signaling any problem or
missing information, please see :ref:`Contributing` below.

If everything worked well with the installation, there are a decent
number of tutorial and examples, but they are quite scattered around in
folders `Demo`, `Tutorial`, `Test`, etc.

You should be able to access information by usual python introspection
(`?`, `??`, autocompletion, etc.).

See developer notes :ref:`developersnotes` for a detailed status of
developement, how to access more recent features and last status of
documentation (on developer brach), especially if you think you can
help. Expecially installation and release mechanism, are in phase of
improvement, as well as documentation.

## Contributing

Please report bugs or feature requests, missing documentation, or open a
issue on github https://github.com/vincenzooo/pyXsurf/issues.

Expecially appreciated is if you can provide templates, examples or
hints on how to handle, documentation (Sphinx), packaging, continuous
integration (Github).

Please check :ref:`README_developers` for the status of the development,
or if are willing to help in any way.

## Modules

A basic description of the different modules is:

- **dataIO** Generic routines for accessing and manipulating data and
  files.

- **notebooks** Jupyter notebooks, not necessarily related to the
  libraries, include test and experiments on python.

- **plotting** Plotting functions for pySurf data.

- **pyGeo3D** Functions for geometry in space (lines and planes).

- **pyProfile** Equivalent of pySurf acting on Profiles.

- **pySurf** Functions and classes acting on 3D points or surfaces.

- **thermal** Functions for modelling of thermal forming of glass.

Some examples and data can be found in a `test` subfolder of each
module.
