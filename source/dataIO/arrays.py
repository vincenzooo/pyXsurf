        1. n == len(arg)  (note that np.size is used instead of len to handle strings more correctly)
            In this case it is not possible to understand if the arg provided is single or multiple value,
            as this can be solved only understanding the expected input shape. 
            e.g.: [1,2] for a two-element input, is 1 for the 1st and 2 for the 2nd, or needs to be replicated? 
            By default `arg` is not replicated, the flag `force_if_n` overrides this behavior.
            2. same problem in a more subtle way when n = 1 and arg is scalar, in this case you probably want to convert the scalar in a single-element list, to iterate over it. If a different need is ever found a flag will be added
